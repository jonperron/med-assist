# Med-Assist Backend

This is the backend for the Med-Assist application, built with FastAPI and Poetry.

## Features

* Document upload (PDF, DOC, DOCX, TXT)
* Text extraction from medical documents
* Named Entity Recognition (NER) for medical terms
* Redis-based storage for processed documents
* RESTful API with automatic OpenAPI documentation

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.10+
* [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation)

### Configuration requirements

The application requires two main configurations to be set up properly:

#### Redis Configuration

The application uses Redis for storing extracted text and processing results. Configure the following:

**Environment Variables:**

* `REDIS_URL`: Redis connection URL (default: `redis://localhost:6379`)

**Example:**

```bash
export REDIS_URL="redis://localhost:6379"
```

### NER Model Configuration

The application uses Hugging Face transformers for Named Entity Recognition. Configure the following:

**Environment Variables:**

* `NER_MODEL_NAME`: Name of the Hugging Face model to use for NER

**Example:**

```bash
export NER_MODEL_NAME="dbmdz/bert-large-cased-finetuned-conll03-english"
```

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/med-assist.git
    cd med-assist/backend
    ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

    This command will install all the dependencies required for the project, including development dependencies.

    ```bash
    poetry install
    ```

## Running the Application

To run the application in a development environment, use the following command:

```bash
poetry run uvicorn main:app --reload
```

The application will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.
